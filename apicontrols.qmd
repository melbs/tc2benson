## API Controls

### Overview

When users sign in to third-party apps using the "Sign in with Google" option (single sign-on), you can control how those third-party apps access your organization’s Google data.

**API Controls Section:**

  `Security > Access and data controls > API Controls`

**Manage Third Party Apps:**

`Security > Access and data controls > API Controls > Manage Third-Party Apps`


### Best Practices

**Students:** (Default) Don't allow users to access any third-party apps

**Staff:** This needs to be discussed by the school. Be consistent with your other app policies. It’s best to lean towards a more controlled app approval process.
