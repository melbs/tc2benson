This is a noteworthy moment, especially for schools that haven’t yet fine-tuned their API Control settings. And for those who think they’re one step ahead, hold on! A slew of fresh updates and changes have already landed in the admin console, causing ripples of impact.\nWith the flurry of updates to the API Controls section in the admin console over the past couple of years, it’s time to take a breather and review the API controls, nail down best practices, identify necessary actions, and map out the route to get there."
