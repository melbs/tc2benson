This is a noteworthy moment, especially for schools that haven’t yet fine-tuned their API Control settings. And for those who think they’re one step ahead, hold on! A slew of fresh updates and changes have already landed in the admin console, causing ripples of impact.\nWith the flurry of updates to the API Controls section in the admin console over the past couple of years, it’s time to take a breather and review the API controls, nail down best practices, identify necessary actions, and map out the route to get there.\n\nTL;DR\nGoogle is pushing us towards a Trusted List approach for OAuth Apps, which will be implemented in October. Google Admins need to set up the trusted list and confirm settings before then."

    "text": "Understanding the Latest Updates\nGoogle notified primary admins on June 19th, 2023, announcing new API Controls, changes in behavior for users under 18 regarding their access to third-party apps, and a requirement to review and confirm access settings to third-party apps by Oct. 23rd, 2023.\nTakeaway: Google is making domains go to an OAuth App “Trusted List” for under 18 before Oct. 23rd, 2023 or students will lose access to OAuth apps. Read the full email\n\nImmediate Impact\n\nPreviously accessed apps should not be affected until October 23rd. Google has “configured” previously accessed apps from under 18 as limited.\n\nThis is why you are seeing a lot more “configured apps”\n\nAny “new” app ca not be accessed by under 18 and the user can “Request” the app.\n\nThis is why you’re seeing requests (from students)\n\n\n\n\n“It’s like Google did the “Stop the bleed” approach for students for you.”\n- Melissa Benson"

    "text": "FAQ\n\nIs there a maximum of configured apps?\n\nYes, 15,000. We are in talks with Google about this\n\nCan I unconfigure an app?\n\nIt does not appear like you can truly “unconfigure” an app. We are talking to Google about this.\n\nI’m having issues with the iPhone native mail and calendar apps when I’m blocking APIs\n\nThis is the full App ID for iOS in my console: 450232826690-0rm6bs9d2fps9tifvk2oodh3tasd7vl7.apps.googleusercontent.com.\n\nCan we disable the ability for students to “Request apps”?\n\nNo. But it is something we will talk about internally to see if there is a work around.\nWe asked Google and it’s “in the works”.\n\nCan staff request apps like students?\n\nNo. Only under 18 can request. We are asking Google. Most likely a temp thing. (hopefully)\n\nWhere does that “request” go (when students request access to an app)?\n\nAdmin Console Dashboard &gt; App access control card\nSecurity &gt; API Controls &gt; App Access Control &gt; Manage Third-Party App Access. Then it’s the middle box across the top that says “Apps pending review”.\n\nCan we see “who” requested the app? Can we get alerted?\n\nUnder Reporting &gt; Audit and investigation &gt; OAuth log events. Then add the condition “Event is Request”.\nYes, by creating a Custom Rule: With the previous navigation then click on “Create activity rule” or “Reporting Rule” (depending on your edition). It will walk you through creating a rule (alert) where you can have it get sent to the Alert Center and email people.\n\nCan you explain the API Block-Exempt option when trusting an app?\n\nThis is for people with Standard or Plus and use Context Aware Access.\nSelected apps maintain API access to Google Workspace services even when those services have Context-Aware Access policies that apply to API access.
