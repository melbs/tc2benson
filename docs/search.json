This is a noteworthy moment, especially for schools that haven’t yet fine-tuned their API Control settings. And for those who think they’re one step ahead, hold on! A slew of fresh updates and changes have already landed in the admin console, causing ripples of impact.\nWith the flurry of updates to the API Controls section in the admin console over the past couple of years, it’s time to take a breather and review the API controls, nail down best practices, identify necessary actions, and map out the route to get there.\n\nTL;DR\nGoogle is pushing us towards a Trusted List approach for OAuth Apps, which will be implemented in October. Google Admins need to set up the trusted list and confirm settings before then."

(remember, Google “configured” previously accessed apps for under 18 as limited)\nFigure out how to handle the incoming app requests.\nLook at all of the rest of the accessed apps and create our trusted list for the rest of our users. (this would be addressing the trusted list for over 18)\n\nWays to “approve” apps\n\nYou can trust one by one, or a couple by couple by going into your configured or accessed app list from within the admin console. [image below]\nYou could “add an app” and trust.\nRecommended: You can download the accessed apps list, bulk change access in a sheet, then bulk upload.
