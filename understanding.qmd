## Understanding the Updates

Google notified primary admins on June 19th, 2023, announcing new API Controls, changes in behavior for users under 18 regarding their access to third-party apps, and a requirement to review and confirm access settings to third-party apps by Oct. 23rd, 2023.

Google is making domains go to an OAuth App “Trusted List” for under 18 before Oct. 23rd, 2023 or students will lose access to OAuth apps.

### Immediate Impact

Previously accessed apps should not be affected until October 23rd. Google has “configured” previously accessed apps from under 18 as limited.


:::{.callout-note}
This is why you are seeing a lot more “configured apps”
:::

Any “new” app can not be accessed by under 18 and the user can “Request” the app.

:::{.callout-note}
This is why you’re seeing requests (from students)
