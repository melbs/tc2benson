## Summary

<div class="reveal resize-content">
Hey there, Google Admins! We're on the cusp of significant shifts in **Google's API control settings for users under 18**, set to shake things up this coming October. This is a noteworthy moment, especially for schools that haven't yet fine-tuned their API Control settings. And for those who think they're one step ahead, hold on! A slew of fresh updates and changes have already landed in the admin console, causing ripples of impact.

  With the flurry of updates to the API Controls section in the admin console over the past couple of years, it's time to take a breather and review the API controls, nail down best practices, identify necessary actions, and map out the route to get there.

### TL;DR

Google is pushing us towards a Trusted List approach for OAuth Apps, which will be implemented in October. Google Admins need to set up the trusted list and confirm settings before then.
