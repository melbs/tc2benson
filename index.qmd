## Purpose

### What?

I'm taking my "one pager" Collaborative Corner about API Controls and migrating it into a single source to allow for multiple types of outputs for multiple types of communication and audiences. 

### Why?

The one pager's initial purpose was an easy and high level view of API Controls but it has turned into a 10 pager, with lots of information and written in various ways (ie blog post, how to, tutorial)

## Summary

Hey there, Google Admins! We're on the cusp of significant shifts in Google's API control settings for users under 18, set to shake things up this coming October. This is a noteworthy moment, especially for schools that haven't yet fine-tuned their API Control settings. And for those who think they're one step ahead, hold on! A slew of fresh updates and changes have already landed in the admin console, causing ripples of impact.

With the flurry of updates to the API Controls section in the admin console over the past couple of years, it's time to take a breather and review the API controls, nail down best practices, identify necessary actions, and map out the route to get there.

## TL;DR

Google is pushing us towards a Trusted List approach for OAuth Apps, which will be implemented in October. Google Admins need to set up the trusted list and confirm settings before then.
